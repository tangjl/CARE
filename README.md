# CARE
The CARE (Cohort Assessment and Retrieval Environment) system was developed by the CS312 team (Jordan Tang, Payal Shah, an Kyle Ellis) under Dr. Bridget McInnes. It was designed to process clinical records for the purpose of cohort discovery. It utilizes MetaMap and MetaMap::Datastructures in the background to process records as well as input data.
